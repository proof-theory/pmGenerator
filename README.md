Code extracted from [deontic-logic/proof-tool](https://github.com/deontic-logic/proof-tool) (still private; [readme](https://deontic-logic.github.io/readme.html)). Can be used to generate improved versions of [pmproofs.txt](https://us.metamath.org/mmsolitaire/pmproofs.txt "us.metamath.org/mmsolitaire/pmproofs.txt") of the [mmsolitaire](https://us.metamath.org/mmsolitaire/mms.html "us.metamath.org/mmsolitaire/mms.html") project.  
Exemplary generated results are available at [xamidi/mmsolitaire](https://github.com/xamidi/mmsolitaire "GitHub repository"). Eligible for high-performance computing. If you have access to a supercomputer, please consider to use this tool to further contribute to our knowledge regarding minimal proofs.

Some aspects of this tool were explicated in a [proposal](https://groups.google.com/g/metamath/c/v0p86y5b-m0) at the Metamath mailing list.
